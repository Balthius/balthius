### Hi there, My name is Josh.

#### I enjoy learning how to solve problems and automate solutions through Code.


##### My dream job is working on Designing video games. I wasn't always the kid with the most games, but the ones I had I played into the ground. 
- Shining soul 2
- Warcraft 3
- Diablo 1 & 2
- Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
- Age of Empires 2
- Dragon Warrior Monsters
- Civilization II
- Command and Conquer: Red Alert
- Lemmings
##### There were many more, but these were the titles I found most powerfuly shaped what I enjoy about games.

##### From the games I played, books I read, really any creative endevour I took part in, I developed an interest in trying to make my own games, and in order to do that, I tried, and have continued to try and learn all the bits and pieces that go into development. From dabbling in JASS in Warcraft 3, to eventually learning the power of C# and Unity, where my dabblings began to move into the realm of legible, SOLID code. Of particular interest for me in game design are Pathfinding, Procedural world generation, AI and the idea of game systems that are deep, but easy to pick up.

##### A few of my favorite games in the last few years have been:
- Rimworld
- Factorio
- Path of Exile
- Grid Dawn,
- Oxygen not included
- Monster Hunter World
- Slay the Spire


#### One unique challenge for me, since I have Aphantasia, is visualization. I know the looks and feel of what I want to create but often translating can be a bit of a problem, the positive side is I often get to act as "the client", where I know what I want but need to create something in order to see if it's the right fit. The rise in popularity of Agile, Rapid iteration develoment and prototyping has been nothing but good news for me and the way I operate. 

#### My personal website is [Studio Soluna](studiosoluna.com), My website has a 95/98/92/80 Lighthouse Audit.

#### I am earning my Bachelor's degree in Data managment/Analytics from Western Governor's University.
