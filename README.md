### Hi there, My name is Josh.

#### I enjoy learning how to solve problems and automate solutions through Code. I've found that the best learning methods for me have involved creating projects that I can put to personal use, or in some way engage with actively. I've created games to practice common patterns and adaptive design, One of my projects was as part of a team of developers and artists making a game as a college thesis project.

#### I enjoy making simple CRUD applications to learn pieces of front and back-end technology. Overall C# and the .NET framework is the most compelling but for extremely performant backend development I would turn to C++, and for quickly and painlessly coded projects I would likely turn to python, with javascript as my alternative.

#### Currently I am working on learning React, Vue and Angular. I've spent most of my front-end learning focused on applications and aside from Razer Pages and Flask I feel I stand to gain the most by learning 3 of the more popular UI Frameworks for web development.

#### My broad areas of focus in Development are: 
- Automation and Machine learning: Developing AI, ranging from simple FSMs to more powerful, GOAP systems. I discovered these through game development but i hope to reverse-engineer them into more practical-use programs. The idea of creating these living, evolving, reactive systems is thrilling.
- Procedural generation: Using things such as perlin noise to create "random" but well-bounded maps, datasets etc. As with machine learning there is a thrill to creating something that can exceed an individuals capability, and do so in the blink of an eye.
- Reports: Creating Analysis machines that remove human error from the equation. The amount of time, dollars,and labor that can be saved by generated reports (if done correctly) is staggering.
- Games: They are a vital tool for learning, with a tangible end-goal that can be tweaked, modifed and shared.
- Teach: I've only been at this for 6, going on 7 years, I'm by no means a master developer, but either actively or passively, I want to help encourage others who have taken an interest in programming, so they can enjoy some of the great successes I did when I was encouraged by others over the past many years.
- Learn, Learn, Learn. Every year has shown me that there is a bountiful supply of tools being created and updates, with millions of involved users leaning into the information age and helping eachother grow and evolve into competent developers.

#### I am earning my Bachelor's degree in Data managment/Analytics from Western Governor's University. I began November 2020, and have completed 2 years worth of credits as of 3/9, with a projected graduation date in Mid-August.
